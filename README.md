***TL;DR:*** FlashWorld enables fast (**7 seconds on a 1x A100/A800 GPU, 4 seconds on 1x H100/H800 GPU**) and high-quality 3D scene generation across diverse scenes, from a single image or text prompt.

```

## Local Web Interface

```
python app.py
```
Then, open your web browser and navigate to ```YOUR_ADDRESS:7860/app``` to start exploring FlashWorld!

If your machine does not have enough GPU memory, add the ```--offload_t5``` and ```--offload_transformer_during_vae``` flags to offload text encoding to the CPU, which will reduce GPU memory usage with little impact on generation speed.
You can also add the ```--offload_vae``` flag, which will greatly reduce GPU memory usage to below 10GB, but will significantly increase generation time. Please use this flag with caution.


On a single A800 GPU, the generation time and GPU memory usage under different settings are as follows:

| Generation Time       | GPU Memory | Flags                |
|----------------------|------------|----------------------|
| 8.5s                 | 51GB       |                      |
| 16.6s                | 30GB       | --offload_t5         |
| 20s                  | 24GB       | --offload_t5 --offload_transformer_during_vae|
| 10min                | 9GB        | --offload_t5 --offload_vae |

## Command Line Interface

```bash
python cli.py --input_dir /path/to/input/json/files --output_dir /path/to/output/directory --video --spz --ply
```

Parameters:
- `--input_dir`: Directory containing JSON files with generation parameters (required). We provide some examples in ```./examples``` that you can use the directory directly.
- `--output_dir`: Directory to save generated results (required)
- `--video`: Generate video output
- `--spz`: Export results in SPZ format
- `--ply`: Export results in PLY format
- `--video_fps`: Video frame rate (default: 15)
- some flags are shared with the Local Web Interface

**Note**: The CLI interface provides better rendering results compared to the web interface, as it uses uncompressed Gaussian Parameters. Use the CLI for comparison if you want to use FlashWorld as your baseline.

## Clarification on WorldScore Evaluation

We identify two primary issues in the original [WorldScore](https://github.com/haoyi-duan/WorldScore) Evaluation framework:

### 1. Evaluation Frame Sampling Bias
* **Issue:** Metrics such as `object_control`, `content_alignment`, `style_consistency`, and `subjective_quality` were originally evaluated only on **anchor views**. This fails to provide a comprehensive assessment of the entire video sequence. Specifically, methods utilizing iterative inpainting often perform well on anchor views while producing incomplete or inconsistent results in intermediate frames.
* **Solution:** In our paper, we modified the sampling strategy from fixed anchor views to **random frame sampling** across segments. We have re-calculated the metrics for all 3D-based methods using this more rigorous standard.

### 2. Robustness of Camera Control Metrics
* **Issue:** The `camera_control` metric was found to be non-robust for two reasons:
    1.  **Inconsistency:** Identical results can yield different numerical values across evaluation runs.
    2.  **Sensitivity:** Despite our method achieving theoretically perfect camera control, the current metric fails to capture this specific advantage effectively.
* **Solution:** Consequently, we have **omitted** this specific metric from the final results presented in the paper.

To ensure a fair comparison with our work, please refer to the following evaluation metrics:

### Table 1: Original WorldScore Scheme (Evaluated on Anchor Views)

We recommend using these metrics if you are developing **video-based methods**. Since re-evaluating all baselines can be computationally demanding, this set provides a standardized reference point using the original anchor view sampling.

| Method | Camera | 3D Consist. | Photo Consist. | Obj. Control | Content Align. | Style Consist. | Subj. Quality |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| WonderWorld | 92.90 | 86.91 | 85.56 | 53.37 | 64.86 | 70.57 | 49.81 |
| LucidDreamer | 88.93 | 90.37 | 90.20 | 41.18 | 75.00 | 48.10 | 58.99 |
| WonderJourney | 84.60 | 80.60 | 79.03 | 37.10 | 35.54 | 62.82 | 66.56 |
| **Ours** | 84.43 | 85.87 | 86.72 | 50.28 | 56.54 | 79.36 | 52.75 |

---

### Table 2: Revised Scheme (Evaluated on Random/Novel Views)

We recommend using these metrics if you are developing **3D-based methods**. This scheme utilizes random frame sampling to more accurately reflect the consistency and quality of the entire generated 3D scene across all viewpoints.

| Method | Obj. Control | Content Align. | Style Consist. | Subj. Quality |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| WonderWorld | 52.09 | 56.82 | 75.92 | 41.28 |
| LucidDreamer | 43.48 | 59.41 | 66.41 | 48.02 |
| WonderJourney | 34.81 | 38.37 | 67.52 | 61.49 |
| **Ours** | 49.61 | 53.96 | 81.52 | 54.63 |

## Statistical Summary (Mean Scores)

The table below summarizes the average scores across different evaluation versions:

| Version | WonderWorld | LucidDreamer | WonderJourney | **Ours** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Original (Anchor View)** | 71.99 | 70.39 | 63.75 | 70.85 |
| **Revised (+Random View)** | 70.21 | 69.54 | 63.77 | **70.96** |
| **Paper (-Camera Control)** | 66.43 | 66.31 | 60.30 | **68.71** |
